                                <p>From the earliest days of computers, people have found ways to play games on them.
                                    These
                                    early computer programmers weren’t just wasting time or looking for new ways to goof
                                    off.
                                    They had practical reasons to create games.

                                    During the 1940s and 1950s, computers took up entire rooms and were so expensive
                                    that only
                                    universities and large companies could afford them. Most people had both a limited
                                    understanding of what these electronic behemoths were able to do and an
                                    unfamiliarity with
                                    the types of mathematical equations these machines were regularly programmed to
                                    compute.
                                    Games like tic-tac-toe or William Higinbotham’s 1958 Tennis for Two were excellent
                                    ways to
                                    attract public interest and support. As an added bonus, computer programmers were
                                    able to
                                    learn from the creation of games as well because it allowed them to break away from
                                    the
                                    usual subroutines and challenge the computer’s capabilities.
