                            service and storefront from Valve. It was launched as a software client in
                            September 2003 to provide game updates automatically for Valve's games, and
                            expanded to distributing third-party titles in late 2005. Steam offers
                            various features, like digital rights management (DRM), game server
                            matchmaking with Valve Anti-Cheat measures, social networking, and game
                            streaming services. Steam client's functions include game update automation,
                            cloud storage for game progress, and community features such as direct
                            messaging, in-game overlay functions and a virtual collectable marketplace.

                        <p class="text-center">The Epic Game Store is a new online video game store created by Epic
                            Games, the company behind video games like 'Fortnite'. And it is precisely the good
                            reputation that Epic has managed to achieve thanks to this game and the development of the
                            popular Unreal Engine that the store positions itself as a rival to take into account for
                            the veteran Steam, since its operation is similar to that of this and other online game
                            stores. During the last five years, this company has tried to carve out a way to offer its
                            own products directly to users, without the need to go through other online stores or
                            intermediaries.This has made them take risky decisions.

                            Origin works in a similar way to Steam. However, it has a better streamlined
                            design and gives exclusive access to EA titles. <br><br>
