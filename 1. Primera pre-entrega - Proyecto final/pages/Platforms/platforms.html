                    Steam is a video game digital distribution service and storefront from Valve. It was launched as a
                    software client in September 2003 to provide game updates automatically for Valve's games, and
                    expanded to distributing third-party titles in late 2005. Steam offers various features, like
                    digital rights management (DRM), game server matchmaking with Valve Anti-Cheat measures, social
                    networking, and game streaming services. Steam client's functions include game update automation,
                    cloud storage for game progress, and community features such as direct messaging, in-game overlay
                    functions and a virtual collectable marketplace.

                    Valve released a freely available application programming interface (API) called Steamworks in
                    2008,which developers can use to integrate Steam's functions into their products, including in-game
                    achievements, microtransactions, and user-created content support. Many game publishers began
                    distributing their titles on Steam that year.

                    Epic Games, Inc. is an American video game and software developer and publisher based in Cary,
                    NorthCarolina. The company was founded by Tim Sweeney as Potomac Computer Systems in 1991,
                    originally located in his parents' house in Potomac, Maryland. Following its first commercial video
                    game release, ZZT (1991), the company became Epic MegaGames, Inc. in early 1992 and brought on Mark
                    Rein, who has been its vice president since. After moving the headquarters to Cary in 1999, the
                    studio changed its name to Epic Games.

                    Epic Games develops Unreal Engine, a commercially available game engine which also powers their
                    internally developed video games like Fortnite and the Unreal, Gears of War, and Infinity Blade
                    series. In 2014, Unreal Engine was named the "most successful videogame engine" by Guinness World
                    Records.

                    video games. In October 2022, Origin ceased operations for its Windows platform, directing players
                    to the EA app. The Mac and mobile versions remain online.

                    direct game joining along with an in-game overlay, streaming via Twitch and sharing of game library
                    and community integration with networking sites like Facebook, Xbox Live, PlayStation Network,
                    Nintendo Network,and Nintendo Account. In 2011, Electronic Arts stated that it wanted Origin to
                    match Valve's Steam service, Origin's primary competitor, by adding cloud game saves, auto-patching,
                    achievements, and cross-platform releases.By 2013, Origin had over 50 million registered
                    users.
