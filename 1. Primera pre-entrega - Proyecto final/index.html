                        <p>From the earliest days of computers, people have found ways to play games on them. These
                            early computer programmers weren’t just wasting time or looking for new ways to goof off.
                            They had practical reasons to create games.

                            During the 1940s and 1950s, computers took up entire rooms and were so expensive that only
                            universities and large companies could afford them. Most people had both a limited
                            understanding of what these electronic behemoths were able to do and an unfamiliarity with
                            the types of mathematical equations these machines were regularly programmed to compute.
                            Games like tic-tac-toe or William Higinbotham’s 1958 Tennis for Two were excellent ways to
                            attract public interest and support. As an added bonus, computer programmers were able to
                            learn from the creation of games as well because it allowed them to break away from the
                            usual subroutines and challenge the computer’s capabilities.
